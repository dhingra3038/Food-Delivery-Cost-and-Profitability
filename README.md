# Food-Delivery-Cost-and-Profitability

This project involves conducting a comprehensive cost and profitability analysis for a food delivery service, using Python for data analysis, visualization, and reporting. The main objective is to identify key cost drivers, evaluate the impact of discounts and fees, and provide actionable insights to improve the overall profitability of the food delivery business.

The primary aim of the project is to analyze the various cost components involved in food delivery, such as delivery fees, payment processing fees, and discounts, and understand how they affect the profitability of the business. This analysis will allow food delivery platforms to optimize their cost structure, set pricing strategies, and improve profit margins.

Tools and Technologies Used:
Python: For data analysis, processing, and scripting.
Pandas: To manipulate and analyze the dataset.
NumPy: For numerical computations and efficient data handling.
Matplotlib and Seaborn: For static visualizations like bar charts, pie charts, and histograms.
Plotly: For interactive visualizations and dashboards.
Jupyter Notebook: As the development environment for analysis and reporting.


This project delivers a robust, data-driven analysis of food delivery costs and profitability, enabling decision-makers to optimize business operations and improve financial performance. By using Python's powerful analytical and visualization capabilities, the project provides actionable insights that directly contribute to better pricing strategies and profitability management.
